	ABSOLUTE URL: http://dash.ga.co/assets/logo.png
	Absolute URLs are links that include http:// and the full domain name before the directory (/assets/logo.png).

RELATIVE URL: are shortcuts that allow you skip the domain name. It only works when you're linking to a file on the same domain as the current page.

How to prevent bakcground from appearing "tiled" (not well placed)   -->background-size: cover; 
To center a background use, background-position: center;

You can select an element by one of its attribute by using square brackets:
input[type="submit"]{}

href means --> hypertext reference

margin: 0 auto; --> means 0 margin on the top, and bottom, and "auto" margin on the left and right. Since both the left and right's margin strecth all the way to the edge of the page (that's what auto means), the effect is centered in the page.

media query --> a technique that allows us to set CSS styles that only activate when the browser is a certain width.

Another popular method to do color in CSS is rgba().This lets you add alpha (transparency) to the mix.



Every time you move your mouse, click something, mouse over sth, press a key or scroll, your browser fires off an event.

$("button").on("click", function(){
alert("A button was clicked!")
});

How This Javascript Works- First we select the element(s) whose event we want to listen to.

Next, we call the on()function, which sets up an event listener for our button element.

The first parameter is the type of event to listen to. In this case it's "click", but we could also listen for hover, scroll, etc. It must be in quotes.

The second parameter is a function containing the things to be done when our event happens.



Semantic tags like <article>, <header>, <nav>, <footer> say sth useful, and defining about its content.

The <div> tag is a non-semantic tag, which means it's all-purpose.

HTML listens most closely to the CSS that's closest to it.

what it means for HTML code to become cruft: excess code that doesn't perform a meaningful function.

The line-height property lets us increase or decrease the vertical space between lines.

Sliding a paragraph down to the bottom of a div

This can be done with two lines of css on the paragraph style, and one line of css on the div.

First to the paragraph,--> add position: absolute; This will break it out of the document's regular flow.
Then add bottom: 0; This will move it to zero pixels from the bottom of the page .

To the div --> add position: relative;

text-align can only align BLOCKS to the right. 

TRANSPARENCY
Using rgba: a means(alpha channel)

You control alpha on a scale from 0 (0% color: totally see-through) to 1 (100% color: completely opaque).

GRADIENT

Radial gradients - radiate outward in all directions, from a central point.

Linear gradients - only go in one direction in a line.

Gradients are so cutting-edge, they're practically top-secret, so you need secret codes to make them appear in most browsers.

These codes are called vendor prefixes.

An important concept in web design is graceful degradation: the idea that websites don't need to look the same in every browser, and that we shouldn't punish old browsers by denying them a useful web experience.

Google Web Fonts (GWF)
https://www.fonts.google.com

levels of tags- first-level header <h1>, second-level header <h2>


COVER VS. 100%

If we set the background image's size to a fixed number or percent, it would scale poorly on smaller screens.

/Remember a media query allows us to write CSS styles that only activate when the screen or browser window is a certain width.

/Whitespace in designer's word doesn't mean white space; It means negative space: any part of a page that doesn't contain words or pictures. 

@media (max-width: 5oopx) {
	body{
		background: red;
	}
}

We're nesting a secondary CSS style sheet inside a condition.
This means: if the screen is less than 500 pixels wide, then style the page according to the following CSS rules.


To make a <div> visible without any content in the opening and closing tags of the <div>, you need to give the <div> a width, height and either background or border;

class names should be short and simple to spell.

Animating in css means to be free to come and go, or roll around the screen: it can't just be glued to the middle of the page.

CSS POSITIONING

Allowing the object to change positions is a CSS position property.

static is the default positioning: how things work if you don't apply any positioning at all.

The relative position allows you to move things around on the page relative to other things.

As soon as you declare a position that is NOT static, you escape from the normal flow and open up the ability to call on four new properties: top, right, bottom, and left.

left and top work like X and Y axes: you can use them to declare how far away sth should be from the left side of, or from the top of, its container in pixels.

When you are positioning elements on your own, no one will tell you what pixel values to use. So how will you know?

Two ways: you can do the math against the other elements on the page, or you can just eyeball it. Both cases will involve a bit of trial and error.

Assigning a negative top value moves things up, toward the top of the page.

A negative left value will move things to the left;

In CSS Z-axes is called z-index.
z-index only works on positioned element.

How to move parts around with CSS to affects all the <div>s on a page as if they were one unit?

ANS--> Remember the cascade!
	The <style>s cascade down from the outermost containers to the inner ones. So writing an outer HTML element that contains all of the <div>s and writing some CSS style for that container element, those styles should affect every HTML element inside the container.

Some CSS are already built, such as the letter "j" used as arms for the robot built (renderd in GWF).

TRANSFORM!
This property can be use to rotate elements.

It's a new property, so it has to be vendor-prefixed.

You can only declare the transform property once.

The transform property also takes scaleY() value.

CSS Animation

There are two parts to a CSS animation:
1. You need to define it.
2. You need to assign it.

Keyframing is an animation term dating back from when every single frame of a cartoon was drawn by hand.

define the keyframe above what you want to style

Assign animation to what you want to find a keyfram property.

A function either does sth useful, or it returns a value.

functions are a type of value too.

One can hold a bunch of different pieces of information in one fancy value thanks to the ARRAY data type instead of writing  a gazillion individual variables.

Array has a special property called .length.

The length property can provide an answer to how many items are in an array?

e.g alert(varName.length)

JQuery .html function moves information out of js into your HTML markup.

$('prompt').html(prompts[0]);

Says: find a class named .promp; put whatever's in the zero-position of array prompts iniside it.

val() JQuery method can be used to give values in an input field.

$ sign is a shorthand that says "this thing is a JQuery object!"

with JQuery push method values obtained from val() can be stored in certain variables.

e.g answers.push($('input').val());

Translation: push the value from the HTML <input> tag into the answers array

The hide() function in JQuery can be used to hide certain elements
e.g $('button').hide();

The hide() fxn is similar to the toggle() fxn.

The show() function does the opposite

--Block elements
--inline elements continue on the same line e.g <bold> tag <img> tag
<div> allows elements enclosed within it to be styled together


pseudoclass e.g <a:link
# means id
when refering html elements such as div you don't put < or >

<span> this is equivalent to the div: it allows you to focus on one selected elements in a <div> tag

grouping of elements in the same block
NB--> % sign relates an item to the element it is contained in.


THERE are 3 ways we style with css
internal css > placed in the html file ---> in the <head> </head>
external css > using link
inline css > here the style attribute is used


selector is used for css
css makes use of the last font and discards others if more than one fonts given 

RGB 
red -> #ff0000
green -> #00ff00
blue -> #0000ff

stepping out of a folder is needed when accessing another folder outside your folder i.e use ../folder you are going to

 .(full stop) is the selector used for classes

we separate css in order to be orderly
and to allow us  reference them to other web pages

padding is the space between the item and the container (box)

Assigning of styles can be done using selector(s)

4th class
when ever stating  values for margins and paddings i.e 1, 2 or 4 values, the browser sets 1 value to be applied to all sides when 1  value is inserted (e.g 5px), For 2 values (e.g 2px 2px) the browser sets the left side and top side , right side and bottom side for the given values.

JavaScript

Datatypes 
The 3 basic datatypes are:
. numbers :-integer, double, float
. strings :- are placed within a quote
. booleans : true and false

Variable : are like buckets where you keep data

------------
JAN 09
------------
Strings
String variable - holds string data
 square brackets [] fetches any character in our string, placed within it is the index e.g [3] returns the 4th index
The slice function carries the first arguement but does not take the last arguement
The slice fxn is an overloaded fxn i.e it can take variable number of parameters

type cohesion where we talk about the == and ===. The double equal sign == forces the data type to change to that on the left

When doing big projects you have to separate parts of the project into modules 
Why we have functions or methods is for us to be able to create a reference.
arguments are also called parameters

	Why use functions?
1. To get problems solved 
2. To modularize the code

What is needed in js is defining a constructor and using the constructor to creat your object.

the "this" keyword allows us to reference the present object

[object][Object] means a new object of the Object data type

_proto_ means prototype

The Object() function is a constructor fxn (parent fxn) that we don't need to define

---------

Recap of JavaScript class
--------------------------
We created a working folder where we keep all our work for a particular site

We are trying to create a logic at the server side the server side processing
whenever a user wants sth from the server how this request is handled and responded to.

The package.json file keeps a register of all the dependencies the app needs to work fine. If one of the dependencies isn't available the app would not work well. 

Remember the package.json file is an object and contains names it contains information

express generator can be used to develop quickly (just like using bootstrap)

npm init - helps to initialise the app it gets the package.json set up (generates the package.json file)


{
first thing done was to set up the package.json file... 
next was to create a server.js file which is the beginning of the app it is responsible for the logic of the site providing a response to the user request...
next is to install the express package using npm istall express -- (dev)save --dev is for installing development dependencies that allow smooth and quick development. (in the recap pure node/vanilla node was not used but the express package which is like a framework was used to create the server)....
NOTE: Express is  a framework for node it simplifies the process of creating a node application rather than using pure node....

whenever you want to make use of node you have to require it
This is done by using a variable name to represent the name of the package
e.g 
	let express = require('express')
a global package does not require a path

	app is an object 
app.set('port', process) the set part is like a configuration
-- services on a web server is accessed using an ip address and the port

DNS -- Domain name system

request handler function contains the req and res parameters

The enviroment variable can be set on the system so the app listens to the port of the system

e.g

$ PORT=5700 nodemon server

remember that routing, middleware, views, and helpermethods are core part of express


route is like the access point to the application it is a core feature

common methods of accessing routes:
GET= retrieve
POST = insert
PUT = update
DELETE = remove


Modularity and Simplicity is now introduced

Module system -->

now using modules the server folder is created with files configure.js and routes.js
these scripts are exported to the server

let router = require('express').Router() in the routes.js file can also be written like this

We are using the router.get not app.get because it makes use of the express router which is more efficient


In the config.js file all routes are added to the routes(app) function  

-->exit to allow the server close itself

Morgan dependency allows rapid development, it provides logs on our server

Three middlewares have been used:
1. express
2. morgan
3. serve-favicon


view rendering engine(Template Engine) - express handle bars

we set our view rendering engine to be handlebars in configure.js

The views folder contains the pages the users are going to see.
An advantage of handlebars is it makes web pages dynamic 

Rendering is a process of displaying a page- we used the handlebar middleware 

Handler-bar helpers
1. If helper
2. each helper

Handlerbar syntax {{}} also takes triple curly braces{{{}}} it allows html markup to be escaped i.e html mark up in the configure section is allowed to be seen on the view section

we are using the Model View controller(MVC)
The model is a fraction of what is needed/requested for from our database.
By injecting our model into our view we have responded to a request


{for in} and {for}

exe means executable file in windows

Waiting for connections on port 27017 means the db is on 

The interface needed to interact with the mongodb server is the mongodb shell or client used to communucate with the server

Database stores related data in a structured way 

The database application is an application that works with database
mongodb is nosql
Tables are called collections in mongodb
Rows in mongodb are called documents (rows/tuples)
Columns are called fields

CRUD - needed to work with database
Create
Retrieve
Update
Delete

commands needed
db - shows the working/current db
use dbName - creates a db
show dbs - shows all databases

When there are no content in a db, it is not shown in the list of databases 

db.dropDatabase() - deletes a db

db.createCollection('collection_name') - creates a collecction i.e a table

db.collection_name.insert({'key': 'value'})

documents are inserted in curly brackets
To have multiple documents inserted separate them by commas

show collections - to view all collections

db.collection-name.drop() - deletes a collection

db.collection_name.insert([{'key1':'value1'}, {'key2':'value2'}]) - to insert multiple documents


db.collection_name.find() - to retrieve all documents (for unstructured output)

db.collection_name.find().pretty() - to retrieve all documents (for structured output)


Writing queries
{'key':'value'} - Equality
{'key':{$lt:'value'}} - Less than
{'key':{$lte'value'}} - less than or equal value
{'key':{$gt:'value'}} - Greater than
{'key':{$gte'value'}} - Greater than or equal value
{'key':{$ne:'value'}} - Not equal 

using the AND/ OR operator

({'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2'}) - AND
({$or:[{'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2'}]}) - OR
({'key1':'value1', $or:[{'key1':value1,'key2':'value2'}]}) - AND and OR



UPDATE

using the update method - update()

({'key':'value'}, {$set:{'newkey':'newValue'}}) - updating documents
(selection_criteria, update_data)


DELETE
using the remove method - remove()
